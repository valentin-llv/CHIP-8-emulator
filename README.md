# CHIP-8 emulator in C

This project is my first made entirely in C. It was a challenge with a friend to rewrite, in C, this emulator that I already made in the past in python. This was a really good experience and helped me understand all the concepts that I learned in C programming class.

There is still some bugs here and there that need to be fixed but the overall emulator is working. I will left this as is, mainly because I want to move on to the real goal wich is to write a NES emulator in C.
